TITLE: A BYTE-SIZED MUSEUM: DEVELOPMENT OF AN EDUTAINMENT GAME-BASED LEARNING APPLICATION WITH WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE FOR PROCEDURAL CONTENT GENERATION

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, the advent of technology has significantly changed how education works. Learners are profoundly influenced by the digital age, consistently immersed in handling digital information. As a result, they form their identities within flexible communities, seek direct connectivity, demand swift responses, and value social interaction. This would aim to provide deep learning that would help learners both directly and indirectly to utilize as a learning media ( L D Pratama and W Setyaningrum 2018 ). Edutainment is also a groundbreaking advancement in education that utilizes gamification principles to convert standard learning content into engaging and enjoyable learning experiences. This method has demonstrated its remarkable effectiveness in enhancing learners’ motivation. skills, ability to remember information, and their overall understanding. This indicate that integrating game-based learning with conventional teaching approaches can have a beneficial effect on the acquisition of programming languages ( Silva, F. B., & de Lima, R. S.(2020) ) Moreover, the assessment recognized various categories of games employed for teaching programming languages, including serious games, gamified apps and game engines. Procedural Content Generation is a popular game design method to create varied experiences. However, existing techniques can sometimes produce levels that lack coherence or alignment with learning goals. The Wave Function Collapse algorithm, relatively new in this field, generates challenging and precise levels, enhancing the player’s experience.
